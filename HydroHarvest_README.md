# HydroHarvest Project

## Overview
HydroHarvest is an IoT-based smart irrigation system designed for agriculture. It utilizes soil moisture sensors, weather forecasts, and machine learning algorithms to optimize watering schedules, thereby reducing water usage and supporting sustainable agriculture practices.

## Features
- **Soil Moisture Monitoring**: Real-time soil moisture data collection using sensors.
- **Weather Forecast Integration**: Uses local weather data and forecasts to adjust watering needs.
- **Machine Learning Optimization**: Analyzes historical data to predict optimal watering schedules.
- **Remote Monitoring and Control**: Access system status and control irrigation schedules through a web dashboard or mobile app.

## Hardware Requirements
- Soil Moisture Sensors
- Microcontroller (e.g., ESP32 or Arduino)
- Relay Modules for controlling irrigation valves
- Irrigation Valves/Pumps
- Weather Station (optional for local data)

## Software Components
- Firmware for microcontroller
- Cloud server for data storage and machine learning model
- Web dashboard/mobile app for user interface

## Setup and Installation
1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the soil moisture sensors, microcontroller, and relay modules as per the circuit diagram.
2. **Firmware Installation**: Flash the microcontroller with the provided firmware code.
3. **Cloud Configuration**: Set up a cloud server for data storage and running the machine learning model.
4. **Web Dashboard Setup**: Deploy the web dashboard for monitoring and control.

## Usage
- Place soil moisture sensors in the field as per the guidelines.
- The system automatically collects soil moisture and weather data to make watering decisions.
- Users can monitor soil moisture levels and irrigation schedules through the web dashboard or mobile app.
- Manual override is available for users to control watering schedules.
