# HydroHarvest: Smart Irrigation System

## Overview
HydroHarvest is an IoT-based smart irrigation system designed to optimize water usage 
in agriculture through real-time soil moisture monitoring, weather forecasting, and machine learning algorithms.
This system aims to support sustainable agriculture practices by maximizing water efficiency and minimizing waste.

## Features
- **Soil Moisture Sensing**: Utilizes in-ground sensors to monitor soil moisture levels in real-time.
- **Weather Forecast Integration**: Fetches and analyzes local weather data to predict watering needs.
- **Machine Learning Optimization**: Employs machine learning algorithms to determine the most efficient watering schedules based on historical data.
- **Remote Monitoring & Control**: Offers a web-based dashboard and mobile app for users to monitor system status and manually adjust watering schedules as needed.

## Components
- Soil Moisture Sensors
- Microcontroller (ESP32/Arduino)
- Relay Modules for Valve Control
- Weather Forecast API
- Cloud Server for Data Analysis and Storage
- User Interface (Web Dashboard/Mobile App)

## Setup Instructions
1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Install soil moisture sensors in the field and connect them to the microcontroller.
   - Setup the relay module to control the irrigation valves, connecting them to the microcontroller.

2. **Software Configuration**:
   - Flash the microcontroller with the provided firmware (`microcontroller_firmware.py`).
   - Deploy the machine learning model to the cloud server (`ml_model_example.py`).
   - Host the web dashboard on a web server and ensure it's communicating with the cloud backend.

3. **System Calibration**:
   - Calibrate soil moisture sensors according to the soil type and crop requirements.
   - Test the irrigation system to ensure proper operation of valves and pumps.

## Usage
- **Monitoring**: Access the web dashboard or mobile app to view real-time data on soil moisture levels and weather forecasts.
- **Manual Control**: Override automatic watering schedules directly from the web dashboard or mobile app.
- **Scheduling**: Configure the machine learning model to optimize watering schedules based on your specific crop and soil requirements.
